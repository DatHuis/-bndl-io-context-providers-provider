# @bndl-io/context-providers-provider

A React utility component for managing complex context dependencies. Automatically sorts and nests context providers based on dependencies, promoting clean and maintainable patterns for context usage.

## Why?

React applications often rely on multiple context providers to manage state, theming, authentication, and more. However, managing these providers can quickly lead to deeply nested and unmanageable component trees, especially when providers depend on one another.

### Common Problems:

1. **Context Hell**: Wrapping components in multiple layers of context providers makes the tree hard to read and maintain.
2. **Dependency Issues**: Incorrect nesting of providers can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
3. **Encapsulation**: Logic for initializing context values often leaks outside of dedicated components, making the code harder to reuse or test.

### How `@bndl-io/context-providers-provider` Solves This:

- Automatically **sorts providers** based on their dependencies.
- Detects **circular dependencies** and throws helpful error messages.
- Encourages encapsulation by requiring all context logic to reside in dedicated `ProviderComponents`.
- Simplifies application structure by managing provider nesting for you.

## Installation

Install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install @bndl-io/context-providers-provider
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @bndl-io/context-providers-provider
```

## Usage

### Define Your Providers

Each provider is defined as an object with the following structure:

```ts
type ProviderConfig = {
  name: string;
  C: (children: ReactNode) => JSX.Element; // The provider component
  dependencies: string[]; // Names of other providers this provider depends on
};
```

For example:

```tsx
const providers = [
  {
    name: 'Auth',
    C: children => <AuthProvider>{children}</AuthProvider>,
    dependencies: ['Theme'], // Auth depends on Theme
  },
  {
    name: 'Theme',
    C: children => <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>,
    dependencies: [], // No dependencies
  },
  {
    name: 'Config',
    C: children => <ConfigProvider>{children}</ConfigProvider>,
    dependencies: ['Auth'], // Config depends on Auth
  },
];
```

---

### Wrap Your Application

Use the `ContextProvidersProvider` to automatically sort and nest providers based on their dependencies:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ContextProvidersProvider from '@bndl-io/context-providers-provider';

const providers = [
  {
    name: 'Auth',
    C: children => <AuthProvider>{children}</AuthProvider>,
    dependencies: ['Theme'],
  },
  {
    name: 'Theme',
    C: children => <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>,
    dependencies: [],
  },
  {
    name: 'Config',
    C: children => <ConfigProvider>{children}</ConfigProvider>,
    dependencies: ['Auth'],
  },
];

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ContextProvidersProvider providers={providers}>
      <YourApp />
    </ContextProvidersProvider>
  );
};
```

---

### Example Output

The above setup would result in the following provider tree:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider>
  <AuthProvider>
    <ConfigProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </ConfigProvider>
  </AuthProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

## API

### `ContextProvidersProvider`

#### Props:

- `providers`: An array of `ProviderConfig` objects. Each config must include:
  - `name`: A unique string identifying the provider.
  - `C`: A function that renders the provider component, wrapping its children.
  - `dependencies`: An array of strings identifying the providers this provider depends on.
- `children`: The children to be rendered inside the nested providers.

#### Errors:

- Throws an error if a provider has dependencies that donâ€™t exist.
- Throws an error if circular dependencies are detected.
